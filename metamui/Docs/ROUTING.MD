## Routing Implementation

Static Routing has been implemented.


## ðŸ“„ Files Description

### `AppRoute.tsx`
This file handles the rendering of all route components using `react-router-dom`.  
It imports route paths and component mappings from `route.ts` and wraps them inside `<Routes>` and `<Route>` blocks.

### `route.ts`
Defines a centralized object or constant for all static route paths.  
Helps manage and reuse routes across the project consistently and avoids hardcoding paths.

## âœ… Benefits

- Centralized route management
- Easier updates and refactoring
- Clear separation of route definition and route rendering
